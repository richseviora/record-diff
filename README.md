# Record Diff

The Record Diff gem allows you to compare and diff two enumerables using a key method. The records can also be transformed and filtered.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'record_diff'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install record_diff

## Usage

### Comparing two enumerables


### Comparing Two Hashes
```ruby
a = { unchanged: 1, dropped: 2, changed: 3}
b = { added: 1, unchanged: 1, changed: 4 }
result = RecordDiff::Matcher.diff_hash(a, b)
first_change = result.changed.first # => ResultSet::ChangedResult
first_change.id # :changed
first_change.before_compare # { unchanged: 1, dropped: 2, changed: 3}
```

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `rake spec` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
